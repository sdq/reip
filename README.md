# Reverse-Engineering Information Presentations

To understand information presentations, we contribute a large-scale design dataset to the community. It includes 23,072 information presentations with 620,878 visual elements collected from the Internet. For more detail, please check our paper ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05194](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05194))
